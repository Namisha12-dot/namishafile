Whenever you make a repository in GitHub, not everyone has the permission to
change or push codes into your repository. The users have a read-only access. In
order to allow other individuals to make changes to your repository, you need to
invite them to collaborate to the project.
GitHub also restricts the number of collaborators we can invite within a period
of 24 hours. If we exceed the limit, then either we have to wait for 24-hours or
we can also create an organization to collaborate with more people.
Being a collaborator, the user can create, merge and close pull requests in the
repository. They can also remove them as the collaborator  vhhvhhthf .i am making chnges to this .
